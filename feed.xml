<p>A mentor is someone who allows you to see the hope inside yourself.</p>
<p>- Oprah Winfrey</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Mission Statement</strong></p>
<p>We are a group of Reading residents participating in a mentorship program to better ourselves and our community. Originally, we started this to provide a way to ease the pain of social isolation created by quarantining during the early months of the COVID-19 pandemic but we are adapting and changing to ensure that this mentorship program is available to all those who need and want it.</p>
<p><strong>Our Objectives</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Build strong and positive connections between older students and younger students.</li>
<li>Give young adults a way to take on additional responsibilities while bettering their community.</li>
<li>Create a safe place for learning, whether it's academic learning or emotional and mental growth.</li>
</ul>
